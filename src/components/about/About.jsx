                Hi, my name is Jian! I'm currently attending Seneca,
                enrolled in the Computer Programming & Analysis (CPA)
                program. Through my academic studies, as well as working
                on personal projects, I have gained experience and
                extensive knowledge on skills such as object-orientated
                programming with C++, along with full stack web development
                using Node.js, Express.js, React, and MongoDB. I have also
                gained a strong fundamental understanding of relational and non-relational
                databases - from designing and creating a schema - to
                incorporating the database within an application, and then to interact
                with the data using SQL.
                <br /> <br />
                I have a curious mind and enjoy work that can challenge
                me to learn something new, whether it be a new language
                or technology. I am always on the lookout for exciting
                projects to work on!
            </p>
